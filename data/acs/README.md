## American Community Surveys
I will not be using this dataset.

### Conversation with ACS (Brian)
* the ACS provides step by step instructions
* dataset contains the total number of workers, not a breakdown by block.
* the tabulation of the work insurance place. 
* UI-covered jobs, the vast majority.
* jobs that are reported to the UI systems of the state. 
* by the workplace location + very complete coverage.
* as I get more granular my error may incrase. 
* the nice thing about the ACS is that they ask people
  when they leave home for they commute.

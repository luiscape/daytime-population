# Daytime Population in California
Here I study the daytime population changes on all census blocks from California. 

### Available Datasets

* LODES: Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics from the US Census Bureau. 
* ACS: American Community Surveys
* Census Tracts with 2010 population data. 

### TODO:
- [x] build base-model
- [x] aggregate up via spacial aggregates and x-walk
- [x] read this [blog post](https://medium.com/sidewalk-talk/the-first-principles-of-urbanism-part-i-18105c03cdcf#.8iom687ix)
- [x] explore the [daytime population](https://www.census.gov/hhes/commuting/data/calculations.html) page from the US Census 
- [x] give the Journey to Work and Migration Statistics Branch, Population Division a call at 301-763-2454
- [x] read about the differences between the ACS and LODES (I have both datasets).
- [x] write up report
